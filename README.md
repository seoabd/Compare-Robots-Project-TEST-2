After testing the robots and upgrading the slower ones, Mate Post delivery service wants to purches a dozen robots from us for citywide deliveries. They need robots capable of carrying the highest total weight per day.

Create the compareRobots function that takes two arrays:

firstRobotResults — the weight of goods delivered in a day by the first robot.
secondRobotResults — the weight of goods delivered in a day by the second robot.
Determine which robot can carry more weight and return the corresponding recommendation:

'First robot for sale!', if the first robot carries more weight.
'Second robot for sale!', if the second robot carries more weight.
'Both robots for sale!', if the robots carry the same weight.
